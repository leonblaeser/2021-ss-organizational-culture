Enron: American energy & services company

- **Jeff Skilling** as COO and president 
- Implemented hard-culture system *rank and yank* which supported corruption and a lack of ethical decision-making
- Enron`s culture was only in **favor of its leaders**

**Extract from Enron`s organizational culture:**

> _"[…]“The desire to sustain these rewards encouraged employees to engage in
deal making and complicated, questionable accounting procedures that
would help the company meet its quarterly earnings, with little concern
about how this would impact the long term financial health of the
company” (Kerr, 1975)._

# Organizational Culture

## 6.2 Example: Soft-Culture 3M

As a result of this soft and innovative culture 3M developed a new core competence, because employees developed projects such as:

- Cellotape
- Magnetic tape
- Post-It Note

**BUT:**

In the early 1990s 3M seemed to have lost its grip on **financial** and **strategical** ressources (_visible factors_). Way to many costly investments in people and products failed to generate the desired results. While no breakthrough product had been launched since the 1980s Post-It note.
