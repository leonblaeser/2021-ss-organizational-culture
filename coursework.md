### 5.1 Characteristics Hard-Culture

A hard culture covers the "visible" factors of the Iceberg-Model

- Strong & powerful climate (**Strategy**)
- Focus on organizational goals (**Shared values, Goals, Vision**)
- Top-down decision-making (**Structures, Policies, Procedures**)
- High hierarchies (**Structure, Policies**)

---

### 5.2 Example: Hard-Culture Enron

Enron: American energy & services company

- **Jeff Skilling** as COO and president
- Implemented hard-culture system _rank and yank_ which supported corruption and a lack of ethical decision-making
- Enron`s culture was only in **favor of its leaders**

**Extract from Enron`s organizational culture:**

> _"[…]“The desire to sustain these rewards encouraged employees to engage in
> deal making and complicated, questionable accounting procedures that
> would help the company meet its quarterly earnings, with little concern
> about how this would impact the long term financial health of the
> company” (Kerr, 1975)._

### 5.2 Example: Hard-Culture Enron

As a result of this hard culture Enron was able to be very profitable at first...

**BUT:**

In 2001 Enron had to file for insolvency.The hard but toxic culture eventually lead to the **downfall** of Enron- making it a company out of many who concentrated too much on the _visible factors_ and no attention to the _invisible factors_.

### 6.1 Characteristics Soft-Culture

A soft culture covers the "invisible" factors of the Iceberg-Model

- Values and ethical guidelines (**Rules, Values, Norms**)
- Inclusion (**Status**)
- Participation (**Rules, Relationship**)
- Equality (**Rules, Status**)
- Low hierarchies (**Rules, Status, Relationship**)

---

### 6.2 Example: Soft-Culture 3M

3M representor of 20th century innovations:

- Core competence **M**innesota **M**ining and **M**anufacturing company\*\* (3Ms)
- Innovative & low hierachical culture: 15% of working time could be spent on self-initiative projects
- Employees had direct ways to promote their own projects to exec. management

**Extract from 3Ms organizational culture:**

> _"[…] Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made kills initiative. And its essential that we have many people with initiative if we are to continue to grow."_

---

### 6.2 Example: Soft-Culture 3M

As a result of this soft and innovative culture 3M developed a new core competence, because employees developed projects such as:

- Cellotape
- Magnetic tape
- Post-It Note

**BUT:**

In the early 1990s 3M seemed to have lost its grip on **financial** and **strategical** ressources (_visible factors_). Way to many costly investments in people and products failed to generate the desired results. While no breakthrough product had been launched since the 1980s Post-It note.

- One-way-cultures tend to tip over in the long-run
- Hierarchies should be taken out of the equation, but it should be ensured that leading management positions have appropriate soft skills
